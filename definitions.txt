Abstraction Principle           - Divide into layers to avoid duplications and facilitate humans life (programming langs)
algorithm                       - set of instructions (ie code) that solves a problem/task with the knowledge of data structures
API                             - Application programming interface

CPU                             - Central Processing Unit
    Threads                     - Takes the physical CPU core and breaks into virtual cores that allow it to run code simultaneously

data type                       - string, boolean, bitmap, bitfield, hash/map/dictionary, list, set, sorted set, geospatial, hyperlog, stream, ...

Langs                           - programming languages
    Compiled                    - uses a compiler to convert the program into machine code generating an .exe file; eg C, Rust, ...
    Interpreted                 - interpreter executes each line of code one by one; eg Python, JavaScript, ...
    Dynamically typed lang      - do not need to specify to the program exactly which data type is assigned to a variable (eg python)
    Statically typed lang       - need to specify exactly the data type of a variable in your code when its defined
    Parallelism                 - code written that executes on two different threads at the same time (eg Fortran, Haskell, Erlang)
    Concurrency                 - single-threaded langs implements event loops or co-routines that can pause or delay the normal execution of code to handle multiple jobs on a sigle thread
