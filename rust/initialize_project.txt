Install https://rustup.rs/
Install https://crates.io/crates/cargo-edit/

Creating a new project:
$ cargo new <dir_name>

This will create a Cargo.toml (similar to package.json for JS projects) and a src/main.rs
If not specified, cargo will assume that the project is a binary. By convention, src/main.rs is a entrypoint for a binary (just like index.js for JS projects)


To run a binary:
project_root$ cargo run

To compile:
$ rustc <file_name.rs>

To execute:
$ ./file_name
